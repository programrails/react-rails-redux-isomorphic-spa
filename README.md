# DEMO Rails + React + Redux Server-Rendered SPA

This is a Rails + React + Redux boilerplate demo demonstrating an Isomorphic (server-rendered) Single Page Application.

It is built on Ruby on Rails 5.2 + Webpacker 3.5.3 + [react-rails](https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails) gem.

The server-rendering mode can be easily switched off by setting {prerender:true} to {prerender:false} in the corresponding view.
